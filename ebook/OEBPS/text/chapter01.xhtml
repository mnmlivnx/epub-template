      <p>Traditionally, text is composed to create a readable, coherent, and visually satisfying typeface that works
        invisibly, without the awareness of the reader. Even distribution of typeset material, with a minimum of
        distractions and anomalies, is aimed at producing clarity and transparency. Choice of typeface(s) is the primary
        aspect of text typography—prose fiction, non-fiction, editorial, educational, religious, scientific, spiritual,
        and commercial writing all have differing characteristics and requirements of appropriate typefaces (and their
        fonts or styles). For historic material, established text typefaces frequently are chosen according to a scheme
        of historical genre acquired by a long process of accretion, with considerable overlap among historical periods.
        Contemporary books are more likely to be set with state-of-the-art “text roman” or “book romans” typefaces with
        serifs and design values echoing present-day design arts, which are closely based on traditional models such as
        those of Nicolas Jenson, Francesco Griffo (a punchcutter who created the model for Aldine typefaces), and Claude
        Garamond. [Source: Wikipedia, Typography]</p>
